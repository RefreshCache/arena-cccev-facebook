# arena-cccev-facebook

This project encapsulates Central's efforts toward integration with Facebook via FB Connect. By adding this module to certain pages, it will intelligently decide to pop up the standard FB publish overlay with relevant details so the user can share with friends on Facebook.

For example, here is the module in action as seen following my registering for RefreshCache 2010:

This module currently works with Event Registration (page 5) and the Opportunity Signup module, and is planned to also work with both the Prayer Request and Prayer Session modules.

NOTE: This project depends on CCCEV DataUtils.
